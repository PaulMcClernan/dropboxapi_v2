# dropboxapi_v2
LiveCode scripts for accessing the dropbox service using v2 of the dropbox API.  In order to get API V2 functionality, I decided to wrap the DropboxAPI_2 code instead of fixing the issues with this library.  Please see the notes for more.

There are two files in this repo:
DropboxAPI_2.livecode - binary stack, including documentation and code for testing various calls
dropboxapi_2.livecodescript - scipt-only-stack, for use as a library or you can integrate as a submodule, for example in a Levure project.

## NOTE
This project uses the dropboxapi_2 repo as a submodule.
