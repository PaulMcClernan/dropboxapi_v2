# dropboxapi_v2
LiveCode scripts for accessing the dropbox service using v2 of the dropbox API.

There are two files in this repo:
DropboxAPI_2.livecode - binary stack, including documentation and code for testing various calls
dropboxapi_2.livecodescript - scipt-only-stack, for use as a library or you can integrate as a submodule, for example in a Levure project.
